When going through and working with a form, the syntax is a little diffent. Here is an example: 
##############
<form asp-action="RsvpForm" method="post">
	<p>
		<label asp-for="Name">Your name:</label>
		<input asp-for="Name" />
	</p>
	<p>
		<label asp-for="Email">Your email:</label>
		<input asp-for="Email" />
	</p>
	<p>
		<label asp-for="Phone">Your phone:</label>
		<input asp-for="Phone" /></p>

	<p>
		<label>Will you attend?</label>
		<select asp-for="WillAttend">
			<option value="">Choose an option</option>
			<option value="true">Yes, I'll be there</option>
			<option value="false">No, I can't come</option>
		</select>
	</p>
	<button type="submit">Submit RSVP</button>
</form>
###############
Everything in this form is connected to a class that connects to RsvpForm. This class is located inside of the Models folder. Because the data types are public they are accessed straight from the html.cs file.
